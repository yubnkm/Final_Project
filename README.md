## Immigrant-Native Wage Gap Analysis (ACS PUMS 2023)

This project examines the wage gap between immigrants and native-born individuals using the 2023 ACS 1-Year PUMS dataset. The analysis includes OLS regressions, Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, and quantile regressions.

## Project Structure
- data
    - `raw.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
    - `pums_clean.csv`: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.
- output
    - `ols_result.xlsx`: OLS regression results.
    - `oaxaca_result.xlsx`: Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition results.
    - `quantile_regression_result.xlsx`: Quantile regression results.
    - `immigrant_plot.png`: Plot of immigrant coefficient across quantiles and OLS

- R
    - `load_data.R`: Load and preprocess the data.
    - `reg.R`: Perform OLS regression, Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, and quantile regression. And generate plots.
    
## Data source
U.S. Census Bureau â€” [ACS 1-Year PUMS 2023](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html)


## Large data file sync
Due to the size of the dataset, it is not included in the repository. You can download it from the U.S. Census Bureau website and place it in the `data` directory. The file name should be `raw.csv`. The cleaned dataset `pums_clean.csv` will be generated automatically when you run the `load_data.R` script.
